## Hi, my name is **Reda Lemeden**. I make software, and sometimes I write about it.

I spent half of my life in my hometown of Casablanca <span title="Morocco">🇲🇦</span>,
where I grew up playing <span title="Atari, DOS, Nintendo, etc.">video games 🎮</span> and
tinkering with <span title="Macromedia, Adobe, etc.">creative software 🖌</span>.

After getting a <abbr title="Bachelor of Business Administration">BBA</abbr> degree in 2007,
I moved to Tokyo <span title="Japan">🇯🇵</span> to study Japanese,
then Nantes <span title="France">🇫🇷</span> to resume my post-graduate studies (<abbr title="Master in Management">MIM</abbr>),
then Boston, MA <span title="USA">🇺🇸</span> to work as a product designer & developer,
before finally settling in Stockholm <span title="Sweden">🇸🇪</span> in 2014. 

These days I write software for a living. If you have any questions or just want to say hi, don't hesitate to get in touch!
